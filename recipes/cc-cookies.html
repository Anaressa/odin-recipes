        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Yields: 48 cookies</p>
        <p>Prep time: 60-90 minutes, spread out over 2-4 days</p>
        <p>Cook time: 13 minutes</p>
        <p>Nothing beats classic chocolate chip cookies fresh from the oven! Spread these out over however many baking sessions you'd like - the balls of dough will last awhile in the freezer (or be a tasty, non-FDA-approved treat on their own).</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (192g) white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup (192g) brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp (10g) vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5g) baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp (3g) Morton salt</li>
            <li>400g (2-1/8 cup) flour</li>
            <li>10oz (340g) chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Making the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In large mixing bowl, cream together butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and no clumps of butter remain.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs 1 at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>In separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Slowly add dry ingredients to wet. The less added at a time, the easier this will be.</li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap, pressing wrap up to dough to remove as much air as possible.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 24 to 72 hours.</li>
            <li>Spoon out 48 equal sized (29g) cookies onto parchment lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze.</li>
            <li>Transfer frozen portions to gallon ziploc bag and freeze.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Baking the dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325.</li>
            <li>Place cookies on parchment lined baking sheet and cook on upper rack for 13 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer to cooling rack and let cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
